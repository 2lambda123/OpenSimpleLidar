"lidar4" is Open Hardware Lidar node for ROS.

Important notice – you need to change “Distance calculation formula” in “xv11_laser.cpp” before building the node.

Some names are "neato" - I do it for compability with the node for "Neato Lidar" (I had taken code from that project): http://wiki.ros.org/xv_11_laser_driver/
